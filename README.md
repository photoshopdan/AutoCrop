## AutoCrop

App which takes a folder of headshot portrait images and crops them using face detection to keep the head scale and position constant. It allows for a consistency of crop that cannot be achieved in-camera and removes the work of manual cropping in post. It can compensate for head rotation and supports custom post-crop image resampling. Depending on the setting, images which are already framed too closely to crop can be cropped anyway, with white spaced added to the top, or it can be moved to a 'crop failed' folder for manual inspection.
